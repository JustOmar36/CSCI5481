For this assignment I will have comments above the functions that describe functionality since there are too many of them.

How to run this program:

to run the program:

"python3 sankoff.py [name of desired file]"

Avaliable files:
['genotypes_chrM_ASW_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta', 
'genotypes_chrM_CEU_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta', 
'genotypes_chrM_CHB_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta', 
'genotypes_chrM_CHD_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta', 
'genotypes_chrM_GIH_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta', 
'genotypes_chrM_JPT_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta', 
'genotypes_chrM_LWK_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta', 
'genotypes_chrM_MEX_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta', 
'genotypes_chrM_MKK_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta', 
'genotypes_chrM_TSI_phase3.2_consensus.b36_fwd.fasta']

Notes:
1. Order of results file follow that of the order in the expirements section in the write up
2. prunning algorithm works at random
3. SNP files have been converted to FASTA files manually. There are no functions that convert the files into FASTA files
4. The program prints graphs. Make sure to exit out of them to continue the program
